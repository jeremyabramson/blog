            "content": "Introduction . This is a first thing, I&#39;d imagine . Problem Scope . Downloading The Injury Reports . Before we can actually do anything interesting with the injury reports, we need to download them. From Basketball Analytics Legend Ed Kupfer&#39;s tweet, we know the location of at least one report: If somebody wants a project, scrape the data from the NBA injury report PDFs from the last few seasons. Just change the date in the URL. https://t.co/SnKpFXPrRl . &mdash; Ed Kupfer (@EdKupfer) April 23, 2021 . Decoding the Filename Schema From the URL . Luckily, the naming schema of the reports is relatively simple to decode. Our example URL is: . https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2021-04-23_01PM.pdf . Looks like there&#39;s 4 parts to the URL: . Some boilerplate: https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_ | A date: 2021-04-23 | A time: 01PM | The file extension: .pdf | We&#39;re only interested in the middle two (the date and the time), as the boilerplate URL and the file extension won&#39;t change. From googling1 &quot;nba injury report&quot; and clicking on the second link it seems like the times may be 1:30 PM, 5:30 PM and 8:30 PM. . Building a URL List to Download (Finding Gamedays?) . Google helped us sort out what we might use for the time portion of the URL, but the date part is actually a little more complicated than we might like. Since, to the best of my knowledge, there&#39;s no &quot;central&quot; page that has links to each report, we&#39;ll need to know the date for every report we want to download. According to the official NBA annoucement, the dates we&#39;re interested in are actually the day before game days, except on the second days of back-to-backs, in which case presumably the injury report comes out the day of the game. . This all sounds complicated, and if there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned about projects like this it&#39;s that nothing saps enthusiasm like complication and extra effort that doesn&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; like it&#39;s in the service of what we&#39;re trying to accomplish. . So, given what we know, it seems as if we have two options: . Get a copy of the NBA schedule, and try to download reports for days we know there&#39;s a game | Just start downloading [a range of?] dates and see what we get | There&#39;s nothing wrong with taking a stab at option 1 here, but this project is about injury reports, not the NBA schedule, so we&#39;ll start with option 22. . Using datetime.timedelta to Construct A List of Dates . Programmatically dealing with dates can be frustrating, and doing so in Python is no exception. Despite that, it seems relatively obvious that we need to deal with date-like objects here, not just string or numeric representations of the dates themselves. (Trying to &quot;subtract&quot; a day from 01-01-2021 without some internal representation of the calendar seems problematic). . Thinking at a high level, it seems like what we might want to do is build3 a list of dates, starting at, say, today — or some other reasonable choice, like the end of the NBA season — and work backward until...well, it&#39;s not exactly clear how far back we need to go. But the notion still seems reasonable: start at a date and count backward day by day, creating a new date each time. Luckily, Python has exactly the thing we need to do this: the timedelta object. . For our purposes, a timedelta object is simply something that allows us to perform arithmetic on datetime objects. Consider the following: . from datetime import datetime, timedelta # Random_date is a datetime object random_date = datetime.strptime(&#39;2011-09-18&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) # Let&#39;s create a new datetime object by subtracting a timedelta object # Note that we&#39;re using the &quot;days&quot; parameter. Try experimenting with other values! new_date = random_date - timedelta(days=10) print(f&quot;Ten days before {random_date} is {new_date}&quot;) . Ten days before 2011-09-18 00:00:00 is 2011-09-08 00:00:00 . . Tip: Adding or subtracting datetime and timedelta objects from each other can be tricky. Expand the code below to see examples of what is valid, and what returns an error. Try playing with negative timedelta values! . The 2021 NBA season ended on July 20th, and from manual testing, https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2021-07-20_08PM.pdf is a valid link (the next day, unsurprisingly, is not). So let&#39;s start there, and count backward until we reach the day before the start of the season, which would be December 21st, 2020. . season_start = datetime.strptime(&#39;2020-12-21&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) season_end = datetime.strptime(&#39;2021-07-20&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) season_duration = season_end - season_start # season_duraction is a timedelta object print(f&#39;{season_duration=} is of type {type(season_duration)}&#39;) . season_duration=datetime.timedelta(days=211) is of type &lt;class &#39;datetime.timedelta&#39;&gt; . Now, to construct our list of dates is actually a little tricky. Unfortunately, we can&#39;t just &quot;increment&quot; season_start until it reaches season_end (that would be too easy). We basically have to turn our season_duration — which is a timedelta object — into a range, and then we iterate over that, subtracting a day for each value in the range. . To do this, we use the .days attribute of the timedelta object. That gives us an integer representation of the how many days are between the two dates used to create the timedelta in the first place. We then convert this integral number of days back into a timedelta, which we subtract from our season_end variable. Confused? Hopefully the code will help clarify: . season_dates = list() # Convert the timedelta into an integral range, from 0 to the number of days in season_duration (211) for day_number in range(season_duration.days): # Subtract day_number of days from our season endpoint (after converting to a timedelta) gameday = season_end - timedelta(days=day_number) # Append this new datetime to our list season_dates.append(gameday) print(f&#39;season_dates spans from {season_dates[0]} to {season_dates[-1]} with length {len(season_dates)}&#39;) . season_dates spans from 2021-07-20 00:00:00 to 2020-12-22 00:00:00 with length 211 . Uh oh, we&#39;re off by one, and a day short! Makes sense, since we&#39;re only iterating 211 times, so we lose one of the endpoints. Fixing that, and converting the above to a list comprehension, we get: . season_dates = [season_end - timedelta(days=day_number) for day_number in range(season_duration.days+1)] print(f&#39;season_dates spans from {season_dates[0]} to {season_dates[-1]} with length {len(season_dates)}&#39;) . season_dates spans from 2021-07-20 00:00:00 to 2020-12-21 00:00:00 with length 212 . That&#39;s more like it. Finally, we have our list of dates to use in our URLs. On to downloading! . Downloading The Injury Reports . For simplicity&#39;s sake, we&#39;ll just use the requests module to download the PDFs sequentially. Later, we can see about using asynchronous requests to greatly speed up our downloads, but for now let&#39;s just do things one at a time. . We need to do three things: . Construct a URL from the dates we generated above | Download the PDF at the URL (if it exists) | Save it to disk; eventually we&#39;ll need to process the PDFs, but for now let&#39;s just store them | Constructing an Injury Report URL . As we saw above, the URL has 4 parts. For simplicity, let&#39;s only worry about gathering the 8PM report, which is the one that&#39;s most likely to have all the relevant information for the day. . As a reminder, the URL&#39;s look like this: . https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2021-07-20_08PM.pdf Let&#39;s define the parts of the URL that are static (for now): . url_stem = &#39;https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_&#39; report_time = &#39;08PM&#39; . And let&#39;s build an example URL, using the first date from our season_dates list: . print(f&#39;{url_stem}{season_dates[0]}_{report_time}.pdf&#39;) . https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2021-07-20 00:00:00_08PM.pdf . Almost, but not quite. We need to convert our date back to a string, using strftime (&quot;string from time&quot;). We use the exact same format string that we used when we made the call to strptime (&quot;string parse time&quot;) previously (in this case &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) . print(f&#39;{url_stem}{datetime.strftime(season_dates[0], &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)}_{report_time}.pdf&#39;) . https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2021-07-20_08PM.pdf . Success! Now we just need to iterate through the season_dates list and download each PDF, if it exists. We could do this lazily, with something simple like: . import requests # Loop through our dates lists for gameday in season_dates: # Construct the URL and download the PDF resp = requests.get(f&#39;{url_stem}{datetime.strftime(gameday, &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)}_{report_time}.pdf&#39;) # Write to disk with open(f&#39;{datetime.strftime(gameday, &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)}_{report_time}.pdf&#39;, &#39;wb&#39;) as f: f.write(resp.content) . With the code above, what happens if there&#39;s no report for a specific day? Or if there&#39;s a network error, either with the server or our own internet? . In general, it&#39;s a good idea to program a little defensively when accessing network assets, especially in cases like this where we know there won&#39;t be anything to download. It&#39;s easy to imagine downstream PDF process breaking when it tries to open an empty file; we could deal with it there, but it&#39;s probably better to do it here, and only write valid files. . We&#39;ll assume that accessing a URL without a valid injury report PDF will return an HTTP status code of something other than 200, which is &quot;success&quot; 5. To handle this, we&#39;ll use the requests library&#39;s raise_for_status method, which can raise an exception when we get a status code that&#39;s anything other than 200 (which is &quot;success&quot;). We can then catch that exception, and skip writing the file. . Let&#39;s add that to the code above, refactor things a skosh to be a little cleaner, and bring in some code from above for clarity: . . Important: Note that it&#8217;s not the .get() call that raises the exception, it&#8217;s the .raise_for_status() call. So make sure you put that in your try/except block! . import requests url_stem = &#39;https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_&#39; report_time = &#39;08PM&#39; # Loop through our dates lists for gameday in season_dates: # Construct a URL url = f&#39;{url_stem}{datetime.strftime(gameday, &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)}_{report_time}.pdf&#39; # Make the request to download the PDF resp = requests.get(url) try: resp.raise_for_status() # This is the exception to catch for non-200 response codes; this won&#39;t necessarily catch network errors except requests.HTTPError: print(f&#39;No valid PDF on {gameday}, removing from list&#39;) season_dates.remove(gameday) # The &quot;else&quot; block of a try/except happens if there isn&#39;t an exception else: filename = f&#39;{datetime.strftime(gameday, &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)}_{report_time}.pdf&#39; # Write to disk print(f&#39;Writing PDF for {gameday}&#39;) with open(filename, &#39;wb&#39;) as f: f.write(resp.content) . 5. From manual inspection of the HTTP headers, it looks like the nba.com server returns 403 Forbidden when there isn&#39;t a valid PDF↩ . . Tip: If you were curious, this can be converted to a generator with the following: . def daterange(date1, date2): for n in range(int ((date2 - date1).days)+1): yield date1 + datetime.timedelta(n) . def daterange(date1, date2): for n in range(int ((date2 - date1).days)+1): yield date1 + datetime.timedelta(n) . # print(thing) . 1. I&#39;m going to try my best to show the provenance of as much insight as I can here. I had no idea when the injury reports came out, so I googled it. Don&#39;t be ashamed to do likewise if there&#39;s something you need to know!↩ . 2. ...and sincerely apologize to Adam Silver next time we run into him for the extra traffic on the nba.com servers.↩ . 3. Ideally we would generate the list versus building it all at once, but conceptually it&#39;s the same thing↩ . Not quite the second thing .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
