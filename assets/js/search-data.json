            "content": "Introduction . This is a first thing, I&#39;d imagine . Problem Scope . Downloading The Injury Reports . Before we can actually do anything interesting with the injury reports, we need to download them. From Basketball Analytics Legend Ed Kupfer&#39;s tweet, we know the location of at least one report: If somebody wants a project, scrape the data from the NBA injury report PDFs from the last few seasons. Just change the date in the URL. https://t.co/SnKpFXPrRl . &mdash; Ed Kupfer (@EdKupfer) April 23, 2021 . Decoding the Filename Schema From the URL . Luckily, the naming schema of the reports is relatively simple to decode. Our example URL is: . https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2021-04-23_01PM.pdf . Looks like there&#39;s 4 parts to the URL: . Some boilerplate: https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_ | A date: 2021-04-23 | A time: 01PM | The file extension: .pdf | We&#39;re only interested in the middle two (the date and the time), as the boilerplate URL and the file extension won&#39;t change. From googling1 &quot;nba injury report&quot; and clicking on the second link it seems like the times may be 1:30 PM, 5:30 PM and 8:30 PM. . Building a URL List to Download (Finding Gamedays?) . Google helped us sort out what we might use for the time portion of the URL, but the date part is actually a little more complicated than we might like. Since, to the best of my knowledge, there&#39;s no &quot;central&quot; page that has links to each report, we&#39;ll need to know the date for every report we want to download. According to the official NBA annoucement, the dates we&#39;re interested in are actually the day before game days, except on the second days of back-to-backs, in which case presumably the injury report comes out the day of the game. . This all sounds complicated, and if there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned about projects like this it&#39;s that nothing saps enthusiasm like complication and extra effort that doesn&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; like it&#39;s in the service of what we&#39;re trying to accomplish. . So, given what we know, it seems as if we have two options: . Get a copy of the NBA schedule, and try to download reports for days we know there&#39;s a game | Just start downloading [a range of?] dates and see what we get | There&#39;s nothing wrong with taking a stab at option 1 here, but this project is about injury reports, not the NBA schedule, so we&#39;ll start with option 22. . Using datetime.timedelta to Construct A List of Dates . Programmatically dealing with dates can be frustrating, and doing so in Python is no exception. Despite that, it seems relatively obvious that we need to deal with date-like objects here, not just string or numeric representations of the dates themselves. (Trying to &quot;subtract&quot; a day from 01-01-2021 without some internal representation of the calendar seems problematic). . Thinking at a high level, it seems like what we might want to do is build3 a list of dates, starting at, say, today — or some other reasonable choice, like the end of the NBA season — and work backward until...well, it&#39;s not exactly clear how far back we need to go. But the notion still seems reasonable: start at a date and count backward day by day, creating a new date each time. Luckily, Python has exactly the thing we need to do this: the timedelta object. . For our purposes, a timedelta object is simply something that allows us to perform arithmetic on datetime objects. Consider the following: . from datetime import datetime, timedelta # Random_date is a datetime object random_date = datetime.strptime(&#39;2011-09-18&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) # Let&#39;s create a new datetime object by subtracting a timedelta object # Note that we&#39;re using the &quot;days&quot; parameter. Try experimenting with other values! new_date = random_date - timedelta(days=10) print(f&quot;Ten days before {random_date} is {new_date}&quot;) . Ten days before 2011-09-18 00:00:00 is 2011-09-08 00:00:00 . . Tip: Adding or subtracting datetime and timedelta objects from each other can be tricky. Expand the code below to see examples of what is valid, and what returns an error. Try playing with negative timedelta values! . The 2021 NBA season ended on July 20th, and from manual testing, https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2021-07-20_08PM.pdf is a valid link (the next day, unsurprisingly, is not). So let&#39;s start there, and count backward until we reach the day before the start of the season, which would be December 21st, 2020. . season_start = datetime.strptime(&#39;2020-12-21&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) season_end = datetime.strptime(&#39;2021-07-20&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;) season_duration = season_end - season_start # season_duraction is a timedelta object print(f&#39;{season_duration=} is of type {type(season_duration)}&#39;) . season_duration=datetime.timedelta(days=211) is of type &lt;class &#39;datetime.timedelta&#39;&gt; . Now, constructing the list of dates is actually a little tricky. Unfortunately, we can&#39;t just &quot;increment&quot; season_start until it reaches season_end (that would be too easy). We basically have to turn our season_duration — which is a timedelta object — into a range, and then we iterate over that, subtracting a day for each value in the range. . To do this, we use the .days attribute of the timedelta object. That gives us an integer representation of the how many days are between the two dates used to create the timedelta in the first place. We then convert this integral number of days back into a timedelta, which we subtract from our season_end variable. Confused? Hopefully the code will help clarify: . season_dates = list() # Convert the timedelta into an integral range, from 0 to the number of days in season_duration (211) for day_number in range(season_duration.days): # Subtract day_number of days from our season endpoint (after converting to a timedelta) gameday = season_end - timedelta(days=day_number) # Append this new datetime to our list season_dates.append(gameday) print(f&#39;season_dates spans from {season_dates[0]} to {season_dates[-1]} with length {len(season_dates)}&#39;) . season_dates spans from 2021-07-20 00:00:00 to 2020-12-22 00:00:00 with length 211 . Uh oh, we&#39;re off by one, and a day short! Makes sense, since we&#39;re only iterating 211 times, so we lose one of the endpoints. Fixing that, and converting the above to a list comprehension, we get: . season_dates = [season_end - timedelta(days=day_number) for day_number in range(season_duration.days+1)] print(f&#39;season_dates spans from {season_dates[0]} to {season_dates[-1]} with length {len(season_dates)}&#39;) . season_dates spans from 2021-07-20 00:00:00 to 2020-12-21 00:00:00 with length 212 . That&#39;s more like it. Finally, we have our list of dates to use in our URLs. On to downloading! . Downloading The Injury Reports . For simplicity&#39;s sake, we&#39;ll just use the requests module to download the PDFs sequentially. Later, we can see about using asynchronous requests to greatly speed up our downloads, but for now let&#39;s just do things one at a time. . We need to do three things: . Construct a URL from the dates we generated above | Download the PDF at the URL (if it exists) | Save it to disk; eventually we&#39;ll need to process the PDFs, but for now let&#39;s just store them | Constructing an Injury Report URL . As we saw above, the URL has 4 parts. For simplicity, let&#39;s only worry about gathering the 8PM report, which is the one that&#39;s most likely to have all the relevant information for the day. . As a reminder, the URL&#39;s look like this: . https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2021-07-20_08PM.pdf . Let&#39;s define variables for the parts of the URL that are static (for now, we may want to download other report_time values later): . url_stem = &#39;https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_&#39; report_time = &#39;08PM&#39; . And let&#39;s build an example URL, using the first date from the season_dates list we created above: . print(f&#39;{url_stem}{season_dates[0]}_{report_time}.pdf&#39;) . https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2021-07-20 00:00:00_08PM.pdf . Almost, but not quite! We need to convert our date back to a string, using strftime() (&quot;string from time&quot;). We use the exact same format string that we used when we made the call to strptime() (&quot;string parse time&quot;) previously, in this case &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;. . print(f&#39;{url_stem}{datetime.strftime(season_dates[0], &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)}_{report_time}.pdf&#39;) . https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_2021-07-20_08PM.pdf . If you copy and paste that link into the search bar — or click on it if you&#39;re viewing this in a notebook — you should be greeted be the injury report for Game 6 of the NBA finals. Now we just need to iterate through the season_dates list and download each PDF, if it exists. We could do this lazily, with something simple like: . import requests # Loop through our dates lists for gameday in season_dates: # Construct the URL and download the PDF resp = requests.get(f&#39;{url_stem}{datetime.strftime(gameday, &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)}_{report_time}.pdf&#39;) # Write to disk with open(f&#39;{datetime.strftime(gameday, &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)}_{report_time}.pdf&#39;, &#39;wb&#39;) as f: f.write(resp.content) . With the code above, what happens if there&#39;s no report for a specific day? Or if there&#39;s a network error, either with the server or our own internet? . In general, it&#39;s a good idea to program a little defensively when accessing network assets, especially in cases like this, where there&#39;s a high likelihood of accessing an &quot;invalid&quot; URL, with nothing on the other end to download. It&#39;s easy to imagine the downstream PDF processing -- that we haven&#39;t written yet :-) -- breaking when it tries to open an empty file, for example. We could try to handle the error at that point, but it&#39;s probably better to do it here, and only write valid files6. . We&#39;ll assume that accessing a URL without a valid injury report PDF will return an HTTP status code of something other than 200, which is &quot;success&quot; 5. To handle this, we&#39;ll use the requests library&#39;s raise_for_status() method, which can raise an exception when we get a non-success status code. We can then catch that exception, and skip writing the file. . Let&#39;s add that to the code above, refactor things a skosh to be a little cleaner, and bring in some code from above for clarity: . . Important: Note that the .raise_for_status() call is the one that raises the exception, not the .get() call! Make sure raise_for_status() is inside your try/except block! . import requests url_stem = &#39;https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/referee/injury/Injury-Report_&#39; report_time = &#39;08PM&#39; # Loop through our dates lists for gameday in season_dates: # Construct a URL url = f&#39;{url_stem}{datetime.strftime(gameday, &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)}_{report_time}.pdf&#39; # Make the request to download the PDF resp = requests.get(url) try: resp.raise_for_status() # This is the exception to catch for non-200 response codes; this won&#39;t necessarily catch network errors except requests.HTTPError: print(f&#39;No valid PDF on {gameday}, removing from list&#39;) season_dates.remove(gameday) # The &quot;else&quot; block of a try/except happens if there isn&#39;t an exception else: filename = f&#39;{datetime.strftime(gameday, &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)}_{report_time}.pdf&#39; # Write to disk print(f&#39;Writing PDF for {gameday}&#39;) with open(filename, &#39;wb&#39;) as f: f.write(resp.content) .

Now that we have our 212 injury report PDFs, it&#39;s time to extract the data in the tables. While I&#39;ve briefly played around with optical character recognition (OCR) tools like Tesseract, strict OCR seemed like a bad fit. Other than that, I wasn&#39;t sure what tool to use, which means...google to the rescue! . At first, I [foolishly] googled for &quot;python parse PDF &quot;, and eventually &quot;python parse PDF text &quot;, thinking it&#39;d be obvious I meant &quot;parse PDF tables&quot;. Apparently clairvoyance isn&#39;t quite built into google [yet], so I ended up checking out packages such as PyPDF2, pdfreader, and eventually pdfminer.six. These tools seem much more oriented toward programmatically creating and manipulating PDF documents, than extracting text. Eventually down the list of google results I came upon this stackoverflow post. One of the answers mentioned tabula and converting PDF tables to dataframes. This seemed promising, . import tabula import pandas as pd . pd.set_option(&#39;display.max_rows&#39;, 500) . tabula.read_pdf(&quot;2021-07-20_08PM.pdf&quot;, pages=&#39;all&#39;) .
