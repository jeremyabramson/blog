    "As per The Kickstarter Model™️, we need to define our three goals.\n",
    "At first blush, we might suggest something like the following:\n",
    "- Fallback Goal: \"Get the PDFs\"\n",
    "- Baseline Goal: \"Extract data from the PDFs\"\n",
    "- Stretch Goal: \"Present the data somehow\"\n",
    "\n",
    "That's absolutely defensible, and has the bonus of structurally aligning with the major technical \"tasks\" of the project.\n",
    "But I'm not sure a directory full of PDFs qualifies as a \"dataset\" you could pass on to someone else as a contribution.\n",
    "Instead, we'll go with a slightly different approach (but feel free to use the above if it works better for you)."

    "Since \"getting the data\" is kind of the main point of this entire exercise, even though extracting data from the PDFs requires requires some [at this point] unknown tooling, we're going to have both downloading *and* processing the PDFs be be our Fallback Goal.\n",

    "This may not sound very \"sexy\", but the reality is that this data collection/\"chewing\"/presenting process is basically [one of the most important things](https://www.sportperformanceanalysis.com/article/communication-with-coaches-as-a-performance-analyst) in sports analytics.\n",
    "So unless you have a *specific* analysis in mind, I think it makes sense to not have a Stretch Goal, and to just focus on the first two goals.\n",

    "## Divvying Up Tasks\n",
    "As per the discussion above, for our Fallback Goal, it seems like we already have two \"high level\" tasks: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Downloading PDFs\n",
    "2. Processing PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can break those down a little further.\n",
    "First off, we can't download anything without knowing *what* to download.\n",
    "Ed's tweet mentions \"just change the date\", it seems safe to assume we'll need to build a list of URLs based on dates, unless there's some central page with links to all of the injury reports, in which case we can just scrape the URLs from that.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, of course, at this point I'm not sure exactly how to extract the data from the PDFs (minor detail, right?!?)\n",
    "But I'm pretty confident it *can* be done, so we'll save a little \"Google-fu\" for later.\n",
    "However, it does seem reasonable to use `Pandas` to post-process our data once we do get it out of the PDF, since it's definitely going to be tabular.\n",
    "Lastly, we might want to fancy with [asynchronous requests](https://www.twilio.com/blog/asynchronous-http-requests-in-python-with-aiohttp) (or perhaps not!  It might not be worth the effort, but let's note it here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking all of the above into account, our **Fallback Goal** task outline might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download PDFs\n",
    "    1. Generate list of URLs (dates) to injury report PDFs\n",
    "    2. Download URLs from list (do this asynchronously?)\n",
    "2.  Process PDFs\n",
    "    1. Extract data from PDF (with what?)\n",

Digging into the above steps, we'll invariably find places where the sub-steps aren't necessarily or obviously entailed by the macro steps.  If this gets too far out of hand — when, exactly, this happens is a bit of a judgment call — it makes sense to go back and revise the outline.  For the sake of this blog post, I'm going to go forward with this level of granularity, and we'll see how far we can get."

    "## Task 1: Downloading The Injury Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can actually do anything interesting with the injury reports, we need to download them.\n",
    "To do that, we need to know where there are.\n",
    "After some brief googling, it seems like there really isn't a central repository for these reports, and they're just uploaded one at a time{% fn 2 %}.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The one example URL from Ed's tweet looks like this:\n",

    "\n",

    "2. A date: `2021-04-23`\n",
    "3. A time: `01PM`\n",
    "4. The file extension: `.pdf`\n",
    "\n",
    "We're only interested in the middle two (the date and the time), as the boilerplate URL and the file extension won't change.  From googling{% fn 30 %} `\"nba injury report\"` and clicking on [the second link](https://official.nba.com/nba-injury-report-2020-21-season/) it seems like the times may be `1:30 PM`, `5:30 PM` and `8:30 PM`.\n",
    "Although from Ed's example, we see a `01PM` time in the URL, *not* `1:30`. \n",
    "So we'll go ahead and assume the appropriate times URL-wise are `01PM`, `05PM` and `08PM`.  \n",
    "Lastly, for simplicity, let's just focus on the `8:30PM` (or `8PM`, in URL-speak) file, as it's likely to be the most complete.\n",

    "### Generate a List of URLs to Download\n",
    "Google helped us sort out what we might use for the `time` portion of the URL, but the `date` part is actually a little more complicated than we might like, as we need to know the specific URL of each injury report we want to download.\n",
    "According to the [official NBA annoucement](https://official.nba.com/nba-injury-report-2020-21-season/), the dates we're interested in are actually the day *before* game days, except on the second days of back-to-backs, in which case presumably the injury report comes out the day of the game.\n",
